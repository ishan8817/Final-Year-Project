# Final Year Project
CPU Performance Enhancement with Time Series Prediction

## Description
CPU Performance Enhancement with Time Series Prediction is a project focused on improving CPU performance using time series prediction techniques. It explores methods to forecast CPU performance metrics such as utilization, throughput, and response time through time series analysis. By developing prediction models using algorithms like long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, the project aims to anticipate future CPU performance trends and optimize system efficiency.

## Code Repository setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
