# Final Year Project
CPU Performance Enhancement with Time Series Prediction

## Description
CPU Performance Enhancement with Time Series Prediction is a project focused on improving CPU performance using time series prediction techniques. It explores methods to forecast CPU performance metrics such as utilization, throughput, and response time through time series analysis. By developing prediction models using algorithms like long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, the project aims to anticipate future CPU performance trends and optimize system efficiency.

## Code Repository setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. After installation, run the main script to train and evaluate prediction models using `python main.py`

## Contributions
Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests to improve the project's accuracy and effectiveness.
We only have a couple of rules and we hope you enjoy the process :)

### Contributing Rules
